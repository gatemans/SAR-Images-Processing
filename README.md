Image Analysis with Wavelet Decomposition and Statistical Modeling
This MATLAB repository contains code for analyzing the log-transformed image E2960902. It includes implementations for:

Wavelet decomposition and visualization of histograms for wavelet coefficients.
Modeling the D2 subband of the log-transformed image using 2D-GARCH and Generalized Gaussian models.
Visualization of empirical histograms and density functions.
Requirements
MATLAB R2019a or later.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository directory.
Run the main_script.m file to execute the analysis
