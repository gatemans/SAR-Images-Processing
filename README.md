# Image Analysis with Wavelet Decomposition and Statistical Modeling
This MATLAB repository contains code for analyzing the log-transformed image E2960902. It includes implementations for:

. Wavelet decomposition and visualization of histograms for wavelet coefficients.

. Modeling the D2 subband of the log-transformed image using 2D-GARCH and Generalized Gaussian models.

. Visualization of empirical histograms and density functions.

This project was inspired by research in an article "Two Novel Bayesian Multiscale Approaches for
 Speckle Suppression in SAR Images" and statistical modeling.
